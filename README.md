## GitHub Actions:
I utilized GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

Running automated tests to ensure the appâ€™s functionality.
Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats required for distribution.
Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.
The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
